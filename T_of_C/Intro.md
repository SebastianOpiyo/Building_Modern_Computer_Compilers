# INTRODUCTION
- IT is about the kind of things that can be computed mechanically, how fast & how much space the computation takes. There are things that a computer can compute & others it cannot.
- Helps in understanding computer science as a science. 
- Basically, what is studied is:

        INPUT --> PROCESS(set of rules) --> OUTPUT(YES/NO)

LAYERS OF MACHINES
Starting with the simplest:
* FSM - Finite State Machine(very simplistic)
* CFL - Context Free Language
* Turing Machine - Advanced machines
* Undecidable
